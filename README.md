# WebDataG-bel21

Dear Sascha,

attached you find my paper, my declaration of authorship and the script. 
I also attached some csv files that were a result of my webscraping work.

One important note is to make: In case you let the script run on your device check for the correct encoding when importing the script.
Due to words like "TÜBINGEN" or "GRÜNE" I could not abstain from using German special characters. Wrong encoding therefore
will throw errors, and this is not coming from the script itself but from the way encoding default settings are set. 
Just to let you know. 


Thank you very much and best wishes

Felix
